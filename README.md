## Inspiration 
Inspiration for this app came from my own struggles in getting things done around my home.  It started with a clothes dryer not working properly and having to wait three weeks before a replacement would be delivered. And most recently learning that a family of raccoons had been living in the attic tearing up air ducts, resulting in over a month of no central air while companies would not show up.
